The Department of Physics, in collaboration with the IQAC of Acharya Prafulla Chandra College, New Barrackpore, Kolkata 700131, is organizing a two-day national-level seminar on the 28th and 30th of June, 2023.

This seminar aims to provide a dynamic platform for students and teachers to gain exposure to different areas of physics. In students, this will hopefully enhance the love for physics. For teachers and researchers, this will give ideas about different areas to explore in their research. This will also be a platform for similar minded people to discuss and exchange ideas.

Our invited speakers will cover topics covering areas in condensed matter theory, quantum mechanics, mathematical physics, non-equilibrium statistical physics, astronomy and astrophysics. In addition, there will be contributed talks covering other areas of physics. Participants will leave with a flavour of a vast array of ideas and information in physics for future study and research.
